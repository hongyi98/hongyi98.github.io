This is the first note for phyogeny, the main content will come from **Phylogeny:Discrete and Random Processes in Evolution** by Mike Steel.

## Graph and Trees
For those who are not familiar with the notations in graph theory, you can refer to any graph theory textbook or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">wiki page</a>. Here I just list some important concepts in phylogeny:


### Definition
+ A *clique* in $G$ is a subset of vertices for which each pair of vertices is adjacent.
+ The *diameter of a graph* $$G=(V,E)$$ is $$\Delta(G)=max\{d(u,v):u,v\in V \}$$
